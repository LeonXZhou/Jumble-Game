/*
 * A testing class for your JumblePuzzle class and its exception. A few unit
 * tests are provided but you will need to add a few more.
 * The code also contains a simple function that allows you to play the game, and
 * another function that you can use to display the puzzle.  You should not need to
 * alter either of these supplied functions unless you wish to enhance them without
 * changing the way JumblePuzzle operates.
 *
 * If you wish to build a GUI interface for the puzzle, you may certainly do so, as
 * long as the unit tests are still carried out.
